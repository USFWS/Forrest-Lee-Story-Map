            <h2>We Call Him Father Goose</h2>

            <p>At Adak in the summer of ninety-four,
              <br> A Great Plains gentleman came down to the shore.
              <br> With wealth of goose lore and a smile on his face,
              <br> He signed on the crew and brought cheer to the place.
              <br>
              <br> Forrest was our guide in moving the geese,
              <br> His hands talk, his voice soothes - he put them at ease. At 10 and at 4, white apron under light,
              <br> Forrest ran in the tubes and fed them just right.
              <br>
              <br> In their new island home now they must fend off disaster, I&apos;m betting they recall a boat and a master.
