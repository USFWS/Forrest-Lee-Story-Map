# Forrest Lee, Father Goose, Story Map

This project was created for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Stepping Up to Leadership (SUTL) program's 33rd cohort.  Each team in the program selects a conservation hero to develop a plaque and presentation given at the National Conservation Training Center in Sheperstdown, WV.  This story map is the visual element of our live presentation given on campus in June 2017.  Thanks to everyone who provided photographs, anecdotes, and personal effects that made this presentation possible.
